Contribution Guideline
======================

Glad you could find your way here. If you would like to contribute to this project,
please read the following guideline. We are happy and grateful about every helpful
contribution to this project.

Coding Style
------------

This project follows a consistent coding style. Please adhere to this style of coding,
and check for deviations before committing.

The coding style follows [PSR-2](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) with additional
specifications. The exact configuration can be found in the file [`.php_cs.dist`](.php_cs.dist).
This is the configuration for the [PHP Coding Style Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer),
which checks for compliance with the coding style.

### PSR-2 Deprecation

The PSR-2 standard was rejected on 2019-08-10. The long-term goal will be to comply
with the [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) standard as soon as it is established.

Commit Messages
---------------

To also make the commit messages consistent and traceable, we use the following
seven great commit message rules.

 1. [Separate subject from body with a blank line](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#separate)
 2. [Limit the subject line to 50 characters](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#limit-50)
 3. [Capitalize the subject line](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#capitalize)
 4. [Do not end the subject line with a period](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#end)
 5. [Use the imperative mood in the subject line](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#imperative)
 6. [Wrap the body at 72 characters](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#wrap-72)
 7. [Use the body to explain what and why vs. how](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#why-not-how)

*Please have a look at the excellent source of these rules:*

Issues
------

Please make sure that your issues are described in a clear and precise manner.
Take your time to describe the issue in detail. This way the issue is more
accessible for everyone and misunderstandings can be avoided.

You can use issues to report existing errors, possible improvements
or constructive suggestions. It is a good idea to create an issue first,
and discuss it before you create a PR.

Pull Requests
-------------

If you would like to contribute your work to this project, we would of
course be very happy about your contribution.
Please [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
this repository and implement your work there. Once you are done with your work,
you should create a PR that (usually) merges your work into the
[`develop`](https://github.com/Cakasim/php-payone-sdk/tree/develop/)
branch of this repository.

Please create a separate branch for your work within your fork. Keep the branch
name short and meaningful. Have a look at
[this article](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/),
which is very worth reading to get a basic understanding about the power
of using different branch types.

A single PR should solve just one concrete problem. Clarity suffers if a single
PR solves several independent problems.
