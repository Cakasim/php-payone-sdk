### Changes

 - **[BREAKING]** Removed `Cakasim\Payone\Sdk\Api\Service::getClient()`
 - Added new proxy method `Cakasim\Payone\Sdk\Api\Service::sendRequest()`
 - **[BREAKING]** Removed `getUriFactory()`, `getStreamFactory()`,
   `getRequestFactory()`, `getResponseFactory()` and `getClient()` from
   `Cakasim\Payone\Sdk\Http\Service` class
 - Added new method `Cakasim\Payone\Sdk\Http\Service::createServerRequest()`
   that creates a PSR-7 server request from the current environment.
 - The `Cakasim\Payone\Sdk\Config\Config` class now comes with a default
   configuration that is automatically applied. The following parameters
   have default values: `api.endpoint`, `api.key_hash_type`, `api.mode`,
   `notification.sender_address_whitelist`, `redirect.token_lifetime`,
   `redirect.token_encryption_method` and `redirect.token_signing_algo`
   [[#22](https://github.com/Cakasim/php-payone-sdk/issues/22)]
 - **[BREAKING]** Moved PSR-7 HTTP message and PSR-17 HTTP factory components
   into separate package which is now available as `cakasim/payone-sdk-http-message`
 - **[BREAKING]** Moved PSR-18 HTTP client component into separate package
   which is now available as `cakasim/payone-sdk-stream-client`
 - **[BREAKING]** Moved PSR-3 logging component into separate package
   which is now available as `cakasim/payone-sdk-silent-logger`
 - **[BREAKING]** Removed log component and service
 - Use URL-safe Base64 encoding instead of Base62 for redirect tokens which
   fixes a strange IV length problem and drops the `ext-gmp` requirement
 - The `Cakasim\Payone\Sdk\Sdk` class now has a `getConfig()` method
   for accessing the config in a convenient way
